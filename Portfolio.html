      <p>He did a 30 day Social Media Detox and a 7 day Dopamine detox, which both had an incredible impact on how he use my phone. In this video, I'm doing a 5-day self-experiment and explain how a simple tool like an alarm clock can change your life. On a daily basis, we don't even realise how harmful it is to spend time on our phones in the mornings and evenings. Time flies by and all it does is leave us drained. Join me on this experiment to more mental clarity, more presence and a better quality of life.</p></td>

      <td>What would our lives look like if we drowned out all the noise around us? In our modern world, we constantly expose ourselves to different sources of instant gratification like social media, junk food, video games, alcohol, or porn as these activities provide us with one dopamine hit after another. But it can quickly happen that our consumption gets out of balance and we get addicted to one of those things. Our brain creates impulsive behaviors where we don't even think about engaging in one of these activities anymore but just do it right away. In order to show you the benefits of a life without any toxic consumption, I decided to detox from all of these dopamine sources for 7 days. During that time I recognized massive benefits like boosted productivity, mental clarity, and overall calmness. I hope this video motivates you to take back control over your own life as well! <br></td>
